projectEuler
============

My project euler things. There are a lot missing as you can see, and there are a couple reasons for that. For starters, I didn't start doing this until I had already finished a few problems. Secondly, when I work on this from a computer in a lab on campus it means I'm probably using python or c++ and have no access to GitHub. I could probably think of some sort of organization to include these problems and still look neat, but not right now.
